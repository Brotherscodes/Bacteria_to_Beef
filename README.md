# Bacteria_to_Beef

## Background: 

<b>

A company named `Improbable Beef` is searching for a bacterial species that has the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. They've hypothesized that the the ideal bacterial species can be found in the belly button. To test this theory, samples of the navel of people across the country were taken to identify bacteria species that colonize in the area. The volunteers have remained anonymous and were assigned an ID number to track their results. Once an ID number is selected, collected information is returned such as demographic info, top ten bacteria found, and washing frequency(WFREQ).

## Project Overview:

<b>

Using `Plotly` to visualize a dataset in search for the most suitable bacteria for synthetic beef production. The `Biodiversity Dashboard` was customized with `CSS`, `JS`, `D3` and `bootstrap` to create an interactive and informative webpage.
